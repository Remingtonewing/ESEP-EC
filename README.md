# InMemoryDB Java Implementation

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer. The JDK is needed to compile and run Java applications.

## Setup and Execution

### Using an IDE
1. Install an IDE if you haven't already. The preference for this project is IntelliJ
2. Open your IDE and start a new Java project.
3. Create a new java file
4. Paste the provided Java code from InMemoryDB.java into this file.
5. Open the command line terminal

### Using the Command Line
1. Ensure the JDK is properly set up on your machine. Open a terminal and type `java -version` to double check this.
2. Save your Java code in a text file named `InMemoryDB.java`.
3. Navigate to the directory containing your file in the terminal.
4. Compile the Java file using `javac InMemoryDB.java`.
5. Execute the compiled program with `java InMemoryDB`.

### Possible Assignment Modifications:
I think overall this assignment is pretty straightfoward and to the point. The only thing that I would possibly add were some more resources
on applications that this could be used for. Additionally, I think that maybe the README specifications could be more of an outline rather than just
tell the student to write one.
